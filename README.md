## 💖 Mood-to-Plant System

Each time you record your mood, you earn **1 Leafy Heart** — a token of self-care 💚

- ✅ 1 mood entry = **1 Leafy Heart**
- 🔁 You can record multiple moods, but...
- 🚫 **Maximum of 3 Leafy Hearts per day**

You can use your Leafy Hearts in the **Shop** to nurture your plant:

- 💧 **1 Leafy Heart = 1 cup of water**
- 🌿 **2 Leafy Hearts = 1 portion of fertilizer**

Water and fertilizer help your plant grow through its stages — the more care you give, the more it blossoms 🌼
